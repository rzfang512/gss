# Project description
This lab exacted data from General Social Survey (GSS) with 7 variables: Year of the survey, id_ which is a unique respondent ID, 
educ which is the educational leverl, partyid which shows the political party affiliation (Democrat, Republican, and Independent), polviews which is tht
political views (Extremely liberal to Extremely conservative), happy which is the self reported happiness level (Not too happy, Pretty happy, and Very happy), and realinc which is the real family income. 

The project was inteded to show three research questions. First, is family income affectedt the self reported happiness level. Does higher family income lead to higher level of happiness?
Or does lower income lead to lower happiness level or neither. What would be the trend of happniess distribution across different income levels. 
Initial hypothesis is that higher income level would lead to higher level of self-reported happiness. Secondly,
does the educational level affect ones' political ideology? 

# Origin of dataset
GSS.xlsx is the original dataset that is extracted from gss.org with 7 variables mentioned above. Update code is the 
code for the analysis.


The conclusion that can be drawn from the data analysis is that higher income correlates with increased happiness. However,
unlike the initial hypothesis which is there would be a stronger relationship between income level and happiness, the data
shows that there is only a slight correlation between the two variables.
